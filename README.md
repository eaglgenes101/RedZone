# RedZone
This project is to make a Redstone-like wiring system for DangerZone, at dangerzonegame.net. Right now, the project has just a few components, but stay tuned for much more interesting things, some of which could be used to manipulate your world to your liking. Muahahaha :)

Currently implemented:
* An extensible powered component system
* Dispensers
* Pipes
* Power sticks

Coming up: 
* Push pipes
* Collectors
* And more!
